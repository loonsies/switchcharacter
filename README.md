**switchcharacter** is an addon that displays a centered, scrollable list of characters on your account, showing job, zone, and playtime information, and allows you to switch characters directly from the UI.

# Features

- Centered, scrollable character list
- Displays character details:
  - Current job
  - Current zone
  - Total playtime
- Switch to another character directly from the UI
- Requires **autologin** (shipped with Ashita) to be loaded

# Commands
- `/switchcharacter [optional: index]` | `/sw [optional: index]` — toggle the UI | switch to character if index is provided.

Add the character index to the command to switch character without using the UI. (0-15)
