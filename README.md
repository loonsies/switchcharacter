# switchcharacter

A simple Ashita v4 addon that shows a centered, scrollable list of your account characters with job, zone, and playtime details, and lets you jump to a different character from the UI.
Requires autologin (shipped with Ashita) loaded.

## Commands
- `/switchcharacter` | `/sw` — toggle the UI

Add the character index to the command to switch character without using the UI. (0-15)
